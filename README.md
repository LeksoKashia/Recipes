# Recipe Management System README

## Welcome to our Recipe Management System!

Welcome to our Recipe Management System! This system allows users to add, edit, delete, and favorite recipes, making it easier to organize and access their favorite dishes.

### Features

#### Search Functionality
Upon visiting the website, users are greeted with a search bar and a message indicating that there are currently no recipes available. After adding recipes, users can utilize the search function to filter recipes by title and ingredients. The search feature dynamically filters the displayed recipes based on any matching letters or words in the recipe titles or ingredients.

#### Recipe Actions
Each recipe displayed on the website comes with two buttons:

- **View Button**: Redirects users to a detailed page for the selected recipe.
- **Actions Button**: Provides users with various actions they can perform on the recipe, including:
  - Edit: Allows users to modify the recipe details, add more ingredients, or update instructions.
  - Delete: Deletes the recipe from the system.
  - Add to Favorites: Adds the recipe to the user's favorites list.

#### Favorites Management
Users can access their favorite recipes by clicking on the "Favorites" navigation item. Here, they can view all their favorite recipes and easily remove them from their favorites list. Deleting a recipe from the system automatically removes it from the favorites list if it has been favorited.
